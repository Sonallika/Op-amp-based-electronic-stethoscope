# Op-amp-based-electronic-stethoscope
This project involves designing an electronic stethoscope that leverages **TL072**, **LM741**, and **LM386** op-amps to amplify and filter heart and lung sounds. The system enhances auscultation by improving signal clarity and reducing noise, enabling heartbeat impulses to be instantly displayed on a screen for easier anomaly detection. Additionally, it provides loud auditory replication of the detected signals for more effective diagnosis.

# Chest Piece & Mic
The stethoscope chest piece is connected to an electret mic with the help of a rubber tube. When the chest piece is placed against the patientâ€™s chest, it provides physical amplification to the heartbeat signals, and the electret mic converts these sound signals into electrical signals.

# Pre-Amplification Stage (TL072 Dual Op-Amp)
**U1a: Low-Noise Microphone Preamp**  
The first op-amp, **U1a**, operates as a low-noise microphone preamp. The high output impedance of the drain of the FET inside the electret microphone results in an effective input resistance of about **20 kilo ohms**, yielding a gain of approximately **2.35**. A capacitor (**C2**, 10 micro farads) is used to pass very low frequency heartbeat sounds.

**U1b: Sallen-Key Butterworth Low-Pass Filter**  
The second op-amp, **U1b**, functions as a low-noise Sallen-Key Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of about **103 Hz**. It provides a gain of around **1.6** and produces a sharp Butterworth response.

# Amplification Stage (UA741)
The **UA741** amplifier provides a gain of **71** to produce a clear display of the heartbeat signals on the screen. It is also used to power an **LED** that blinks whenever the mic detects sound signals.

# Audio Amplification Stage (LM386)
The final stage uses an **LM386** audio amplifier. This power amplifier IC has built-in biasing and inputs that are referred to ground, and it provides a gain of **20**. It can drive any type of headphones or speakers, including low impedance (**8 ohm**) ones.
